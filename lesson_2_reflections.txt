What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
because i want to use repository to track changes that i made to files in that directory so that i can change states of files in that directory as i wish.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
 I got it!!! if we have a staging area we can add multiple file and modify multiple file during the same time.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
 I can just take one logical change and add it to the staging area. then commit it. In this way i can commit one change at a time.
 

note: git branch git branch easy-mode

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
when you want to add some new flavor to your program but donâ€™t want to destroy the original file. 

note: git checkout -b new_branch_name
