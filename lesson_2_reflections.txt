What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
because i want to use repository to track changes that i made to files in that directory so that i can change states of files in that directory as i wish.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
 I got it!!! if we have a staging area we can add multiple file and modify multiple file during the same time.
