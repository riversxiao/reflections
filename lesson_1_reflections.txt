my  mind map for the first lesson 
first use search and type in terminal and then cd to downloads
and the diff -u file1 file2
this compares two files 
q: no clear with -u

How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
  i think that when using diff,there is a minus and a plus in the two files to show file differences. this is usually where the difference appears.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
  then i can constantly correct my error or to have a better idea to know where to go.
what is a typo

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
  well i think the main pros are that you can create just in enough commits instead of having too much or too little. but to decide just the right saving timing is a big challenge.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
 well in git there are usually multiple files that are interrelated while doc like google doc are most of time independent with each other.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

  well this is just simple, all you have to do is to typing git log and the copy ID after commit and the use git diff

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
  since i donâ€™t have to worry about code lost or revise the code or forget the code , i can do any changes i want cause i can always 
get it back.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
